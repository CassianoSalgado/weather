# Weather App

It's an app where you can see the weather, amongst other data, in any city in the world.

## Stack

- How to deal with data conversion
- How to use MapKit
- How to use TableView with sections
- How to implement a search bar
- Learned more about the InterfaceBuilder, Constraints, MVC

## What's missing?

- AutoComplete in search bar
- Could have worked a litte bit more on the design
- Keep only the cities on the results of the TableView
- Show forecast of the week, not just the present day
- Update forecast and clock data in real time
